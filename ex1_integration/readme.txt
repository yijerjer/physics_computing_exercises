Core Task 1
- used MC integration based off equations 1 to 4 in the handout
- plotted the error of the MC integration with error against the number of samples, N, which can be found in ex1_core_1.pdf. 
- the log-log plot gives a graident of -1/2, which indicates that the errors does fall off with N^(-1/2)
- with N = 10^7, the value of the integral we get is 537.18, with error of 0.012
