Core Task 1
- ex3_core.py contains the code that creates the circular wire (with N segments) and calculates the B field.
- ex3_core_1_theoretical.py plots two graphs - the calculated and theoretical B field along the x axis at N = 20, 
  and the difference between the calculated and theoretical B field at different values of N.
- ex3_core_1_xy.py plots the field in the xy plane. Note that the max B field is capped at 2 in the plot so that
  the colour gradient away from the coil is more visible.

Core Task 2
- ex3_core_2_xy.py plots the B field with the Helmholtz coil
- ex3_core_2_xy_big.pdf shows the two coils zoomed out, whilst ex3_core_2_xy_zoom.pdf shows the area near the origin
- in the 10cm tall and wide cylinder, the B field has a mean of 0.7173, with a percentage deviation of 0.03%. 
  Therefore, the field is pretty much constant near the origin

Supplmentary Task
 - ex3_supp_xy.py plots the B field in the x-y plane with 10 coils
 - ex3_supp_x.py plots the B field along the x axis for different number of coils
 - can see that as the number of coils increase, the B field at the centre of the solenoid becomes stronger
